Features I want for this project:
- CI System
    - pull request -> github actions -> cloud run
    - stretch goal: non-managed kubernetes: google kubernetes engine
    - alternative: use docker compose to save money?
- tests
    - convert existing tests to pytest
    - write unit, integration, and smoke tests
    - automate testing and include in CI system
- become stateless -> REST compliance
    - store model state in database not memory
- more core functionality
    - data ingestion pipeline
        - pub/sub to dataflow/some pub sub ingestion service
        - SQL/structured database for storing requests/shapes
        - allow users to access saved shapes for something
    - other model architectures
        - CNN model
        - model picker
        - model editor
            - lots of frontend stuff
        - user input for class/shape names
    - train more than 2 classes
    - model benchmarking
        - allow users to create test sets with their own images or images other people created and evaluate model performance
- general improvements:
    - better type hinting
    - docstrings
    - data/type validation (pydantic)
    - make DenseModel less messy
    - proper logging
- machine learning stuff 
    - Dense model improvements
        - accelerate training, parallelize whenever possible
        - train in background job
